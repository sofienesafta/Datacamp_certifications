I have validated all the columns against the criteria in the dataset table:\n* week: numeric values range from 1 to 6 weeks, without missing values.No cleaning is needed.\n* sales_method: categorical values. There are 5 unique values which we transformed to 3 unique values same as the description: 'Email + call' ; 'Call' and 'Email'.There is no missing values.\n* customer_id: caracter values without missing values. There are 15000 unique values as expected.No cleaning is needed.\n* nb_sold: numeric values with no missing data. No cleaning is needed.\n* revenue: numeric continous values with 1047 missing values. We removed dataset rows containing these missing values since they form 7%. The remaining values are rounded to 2 decimal places as expected.\n* years_as_customer : numeric values range from 0 to 63 with no missing values. We should mention that values above 38 years are not logical since the company is founded in 1984. These outlying values(>38) can be caused by typing error.These values should be verified because they are wrong.\n* nb_site_visits: numeric values with no missing values.

Selling with \"Call\" strategy  brings the lowest revenue compared to other sales strategies.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"da08f0b7-2b85-4574-a759-f16c25e5310a"},{"source":"![fig4](4.png)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bd80d6d2-2179-493e-8df6-f43943c3d0bf"},{"source":"From above we can exclude the \"Call\" sales method since it is more costfull (takes more time) and provide the less revenue.We can notice also from the bar chart below that the number of customers for \"Email\" method decreases over time.

This suggests that the \"Email + call\" approach is more interesting over time than selling by \"Email\" strategy.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"85350063-da4a-4d5a-a06c-081d13b75842"},{"source":"![fig5](5.png)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"df3c0160-cb4e-4889-97c5-51495d63eb98"},{"source":"### Is there any difference about the customers in each group","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"334fc08e-596c-4546-a826-0ed12cd0d4f3"},{"source":"It is important to check if there is any difference between the customers targeted in each group.

The missing values of revenue for each sales method were estimated as the mean of revenue for this method.

We conclude also that  for \"Email + call\" method the revenue is the highest on average and the number of orders increases over weeks. On the other side the number of orders decreases over time for the \"Email\" sale strategy. Thus the \"Email + call\" appoach is more profitable for the company.\n\nFor the following weeks, I would recommend we can focus on the following steps:\n\n- Using the defined key metric to monitor whether the total revenue of new products is increasing.\n- Using the strategy of **\"Email + call\"** for selling the new products because it is more profitable than the other strategies (more global revenue and does not require much time from the team).\n- Collecting new data related to the new products types or categories to further analysis and to identify the best sales strategy that works for each type of new products.\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a99ba8a9-bf73-442a-a968-a0810677cc2a"},{"source":"## ✅ When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
